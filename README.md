# MovieSearch UI

Welcome to the **MovieSearch UI** project! This guide will help you create a user interface for interacting with the MovieSearch dataset, indexed in an Appbase app. Weâ€™ll leverage **DejaVu**, a user-friendly UI for Elasticsearch, to explore and manage the dataset.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd moviesearch
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @appbaseio/reactivesearch
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Development Flow

1. Initialize the React app.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Explore the MovieSearch dataset via DejaVu.
4. Develop the UI incrementally, generating code snippets in Codesandbox.io for testing.

## Demonstration
